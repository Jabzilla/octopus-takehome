I hope you've enjoyed my solution, for future steps I'd add in the following:

- An ability to view what's in the basket, delete items from it and see the total price (which would make the use of context make a bit more sense)
- Adjust the CSS of the badge on the basket (it pushes the icon a bit still currently which is annoying!)
- Extend the test suite with basket controls as well as any additional requirements that may come to light
- Add CodeGen for GraphQL types ideally
